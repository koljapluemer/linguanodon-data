# Linguanodon Data

## Goal

- Provide pure JSON data for the *linguanodon* frontend

## Functionality

- Editors administrate data in `data/` `JSON` files
- `convert_data.py` creates `public/`, which contains compressed `JSON` files, optimized for API-like access
- `public/` directory is deployed as a "static site" on Netlify
