# Generating Set Data

We want to use the levanti dataset to get learning data for a language learning app.
To do that, we use the filtered db (generated by `01`) and then implement a similar word counter like in `02`.

Looping all words that appear in 25-50 different sentences in the dataset, for each, we create a JSON file like this, in `data/`:

```json
{
    "language": "ar",
    "tasks": [
        "Make a sentence with '$word'."
    ],
    "unitsOfMeaning": [
        {
            "uid": "apc_انتبهي يا بنت_sentence",
            "language": "apc",
            "content": "انتبهي يا بنت.",
            "linguType": "sentence",
            "license": "CC-BY-NC-4.0",
            "owner": "Guy Mor-Lan",
            "ownerLink": "https://huggingface.co/guymorlan",
            "source": "Levanti Dataset",
            "sourceLink": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/guymorlan/levanti",
            "translations": ["en_Watch out, girl!_sentence"]
        },
        {
            "language": "en",
            "content": "Watch out, girl!",
            "linguType": "sentence",
            "license": "CC-BY-NC-4.0",
            "owner": "Guy Mor-Lan",
            "ownerLink": "https://huggingface.co/guymorlan",
            "source": "Levanti Dataset",
            "sourceLink": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/guymorlan/levanti",
            "translations": ["apc_انتبهي يا بنت_sentence"]
        },
        // contains such objects for all sentences where the word occurs
    ]
}
```

**Note**: We count how many different sentences each word appears in (not total word occurrences), and only include words that appear in 25-50 different sentences. This ensures good variety of contexts for language learning.
